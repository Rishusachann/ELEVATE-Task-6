# ELEVATE-Task-6
We implemented a complete KNN classification pipeline using the Iris dataset. First, we preprocessed the data by encoding the target labels and normalizing the features. Then, we trained a KNeighborsClassifier using different values of K, compared performance using accuracy scores, and visualized train vs test accuracy to understand bias-variance tradeoff. We evaluated the final model with a confusion matrix, classification report, and a ROC curve (for binary class simplification). To enhance analysis, we visualized the decision boundaries using both PCA-reduced 2D space and feature pair combinations. We further explored the model with GridSearchCV for best K selection, neighbor visualization, and permutation-based feature importance. Finally, we plotted a learning curve to understand how model performance evolves with training data size.
